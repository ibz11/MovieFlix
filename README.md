# MovieFlix
A React movie application with two backends.
1.Server file -Built the backend  with Node and Express</br>
2.Server2 File- Built the backend with ASP.NET minimal Api </br>

This application was built to test my knowledge on the Express framework and ASP.NET framework.I learnt how to intergrate with a React application to serve a full stack project.

#  Features of the APP
The react app has two pages where one can view all the movies and as well click on movie to watch a trailer and get details about the movie.
- It has a <u>Search functionality</u> using useState to store query and useEffect for changing state of the page.
